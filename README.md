## Zoo Database Management System

This project is a comprehensive relational database solution developed for managing zoo operations, created as part of the course **CS 1103 - Introduction to Databases** at the University of New Brunswick.

It covers key administrative functionalities including:

- **Animal tracking and cage management**  
- **Visitor logs and adoption records**  
- **Keeper scheduling and care routines**  
- **Insightful SQL queries for reports and analysis**

The system was developed using **SQL** and integrated with a **Java application via JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)**. This allowed for dynamic interaction with the database, including real-time schema creation, data insertion, and query execution from a Java interface.

This repository includes the ER diagram, DDL statements, sample insert scripts, Java source code (with JDBC), and a final project report.
